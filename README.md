### A simple proyect to practice TDD.
This was a project created to practice TDD

Things to keep in mind and help you improve your clean code: 
 * Work in pairs
 * Each one works one step at a time
 * Swap as soon as you finish
 * Dont talk, the other participan should be able to understand your intentions by reading your code.

The algorithm is not the best in terms of efficiency but the objective was to practive TDD.
